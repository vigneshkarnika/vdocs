- free to soft 
- turn off all modulations > option click
- vectormode=off
- envelop3 attack release=0

### Generation
- osc generates sound- turn on sin
- 12 semitones 
- 100 cents
- sin,square,triangle and saw
- 2nd osc=-12semitones saw
- 3rd osc=-7 semitones-square(perfect fifth)
- reduce gain volume
- triangle mix
- poly mono legato
- voices=max play simultaneously , unison=4
- unison= 20 copies on same note(works with analog)
- filters 2
- parallel/series adjust percentage
