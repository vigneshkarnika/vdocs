# DRUM sequencing
-  sampler> mapping> edit> load samples as folders
## Note Length
- hold alt to copy duplicate
- usually we use 4/8/16 bar loop
- create 4 bar loop
- full note,1/2,1/4,1/8,1/16 notes
- record high hat and quantize to 1/8

## counting and time
- 4/4 means 4 beats/measure
- 1,2,3,4= counting= downbeat
- 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 =upbeat (ands are upbeat)
- usually kick will be in downbeat, clap/snare will be in upbeat
- for example hiphop / pop they play first beat kick  and clap/snare on third beat
- depending on 4th beat another beat placement will get different sounds
- we can also play in regular time- half beat
- first beat kick , 2 and 4 clap and snare
- first beat kick , 2 and 4 clap and snare (can go even more smaller double time)
## Triplets
- creating 3 notes in 4 bars (quantize 1/8 12 notes)
- gives swing feel unlike normal 4 bars

## DRUM PATTERNS
### Basic Drum Pattern
#### syncopation= a temporary displacement of regular metrical accent in music caused typically by stressing weak beat (syncopated rhythm, passage or dance step )

- creating beat in 4/4 is basic (which we already seen)


---
### Road Runner
- will start with putting 3 notes in 8th note(with in 1/4 of 1)(1.1 of 1.4)
- ctrl+M to mute that piano roll notes
