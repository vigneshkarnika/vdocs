# Computer Vision is a cutting edge field of computer science that aims to enable computers to understand what is being seen in an image

this is very challenging because:
- camera sensor and lens limitations (light,pixels)
- viewpoint variations
- lighting
- scaling
- non rigid deformations
- Occlusion( there is something you want to see, but can't due to some property of your sensor setup, or some event.)
- clutter (bg- starfish in mud)
- object class variations(beds)
- Ambigous / optical illusions

Success Areas:
- Self driving cars
- Face detection /recognition
- search engine image search
- license plate reading
- handwriting recognition 
- snapchat&MSQRD face filters
- Object recognition 
- Ball and player tracking in sports
- and many more
